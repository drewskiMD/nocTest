    <h1>North of Charlotte</h1>
    <p>Healthcare disparities are often marked with very thin lines. Here in Nashville, our team daily crosses one named Charlotte Avenue. Its four lanes signal a transition from ubiquitous organic grocers and hot-yoga clubs to food deserts and decaying parks plagued by violence. We each chose to learn the medical arts in this environment however, hoping that by training among North Nashville&rsquo;s safety-net populace we would have the best chance of impacting its health on a grand scale. The brand of care we aim to deliver provides culturally and linguistically tailored medicine to groups with no choice as though they had every option. This is not a distant, lofty goal – it is a daily mission born of and practiced through our experiences.</p>
